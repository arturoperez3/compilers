In this project we incorporated semantic action into our parser so we can create Abstract Syntax Trees 
for the Tiger language. Every Tiger rule now has a corresponding semantic action. The assignment was 
tough at first to understand, but once you got the hand of matching constructors and types, it became
more like a matching game.
