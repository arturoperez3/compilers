In this project we incorporated a typechecker for the Tiger language. The purpose of the
type checker is to determine the type for every expression in a program, and to ensure that expressions appear in
places that are type consistent. Dr Roth was correct in telling us this project will take a considerable amount of 
time. I believe that I have implemented the base assignment, as well as the extensions for array and 
records references/declarations.
