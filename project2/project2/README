In this project we built a lexical analyzer for the Tiger language using flex. 
This lexical analyzer can:
    - recognize all the Tiger symbols and reserved words as specified by the spec 
    and the tokens.h file. 
    - recognize Tiger comments.
    - ignores whitespace characters.
    - recognize and return string literals. 
    - properly handles errors such as unrecognizable character, unterminated comment,
    unterminated string, and unmatched closing comment. 

I also implemented extension 1 to properly handle nested comments. If I had more time 
I would have loved to implement the other 2 extensions. Handling and encapsulating the 
various states (such as INITIAL, STRNG, COMMENT) was interesting and intuitive.
